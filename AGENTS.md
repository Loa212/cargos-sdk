# Agent Guidelines & Workflows

This document contains guidelines and workflows for AI agents working on this codebase.

## General Guidelines

Use pnpm for all package management, all scripts and commands.

## QUALITY EXPECTATIONS

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes
someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt
that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this
project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners
you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.
